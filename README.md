# Data Science
This is the statistical project. It is about a Data Set which is Laliga football and in each collab file, we should calculate and plot some information about the Laliga.
The Data Set contains information such as bord, home, away, and season between ``` 1995-96 ``` to ``` 2020-21 ```.
| File  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [First](https://github.com/nawidadkhah/dataScience-linearAlgebra/blob/master/Data-Science/1.ipynb)  |In this file, we find the most champion team in 25 years and plot it, using Bar and pie chart  |
| [Second](https://github.com/nawidadkhah/dataScience-linearAlgebra/blob/master/Data-Science/2.ipynb)| We find Real Madrid's rank in each season during these 25 years and plot it using a Line chart |
| [Third](https://github.com/nawidadkhah/dataScience-linearAlgebra/blob/master/Data-Science/3.ipynb)| We want to find the statistic when a team wins in the first half with 2 goals and eventually wins these conditions the whole match |
| [Fourth](https://github.com/nawidadkhah/dataScience-linearAlgebra/blob/master/Data-Science/4.ipynb) | We calculated statistics of when a home team loses or draws on the 13th of the month and it was Friday. and calculated when a home team wins on the 13th of the month and it was Friday |

# Linear Algebra
in the Span Grid Quiver, we have three conditions and for each one, three vectors.
we draw them on the grid and compare them to each other.
